            <p>She went in to see her father and mother, and there was such <a href="lark5.html"><span class="lark-link tooltip">joy
            <span class="tooltiptext">
                    great joy when she arrived
                </span>
            </span></a> that there was no end to it. None of them could thank her enough for all she had done for them. They now had everything they could wish for, as good as good could be. Then they wanted to know how <span style="font-style:italic">she</span> was.</p>
            <p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. I don't know what else she said, but I don't think she told any of them the whole story. That afternoon, after they had eaten dinner, everything happened as the white bear had said it would. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she remembered what the white bear had said, and wouldn't go with her.<p>

        <div class="text t2">
            <p>&#x93;What we have to talk about we can talk about any time,&#x94; she said, and put her mother off. But somehow or other, her mother got to her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. She told her how every night, after she had gone to bed, a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light, and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she was terribly sad, for she wanted so much to see him, and how she was by herself all day long, and how dreary, and lonesome it was.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Oh dear,&#x94; said her mother; &#x93;it may well be a troll you are sleeping with! But now I'll give you some good advice how to see him. I'll give you a candle stub, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light it while he is asleep, but be careful not to drop any tallow on him.&#x94;</p>

            <p>Yes, she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom, and that evening the white bear came and took her away.</p>
            <p>But when they had gone a piece, the white bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said.</p>
            <p>She couldn't deny that it had.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Take care,&#x94; said he, &#x93;if you have listened to your mother's advice, you will bring bad luck on us both, and it will be finished with the two of us.&#x94;</p>
            <p>No, by no means!</p>
