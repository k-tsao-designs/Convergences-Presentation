            <p>Now when the time had come for him to return home, he had bought pearls and diamonds for the two oldest ones, but he had searched everywhere in vain for a singing, springing lark for the youngest one. This made him very sad, for she was his favorite child.</p>
            <p>His path led him through a forest, in the middle of which there was a splendid castle. Near the castle there stood a tree, and at the very top of the tree he saw a singing, springing lark.</p>

            <p>&#x93;Aha, you are just what I have been looking for,&#x94; he said happily, then told his servant to climb up and catch the little creature.</p>
            <p>But as he approached the tree, a lion jumped up from beneath it, shook himself, and roared until the leaves on the trees trembled. &#x93;I will eat up anyone who tries to steal my singing, springing lark!&#x94; he cried.</p>
            <p>The man said, &#x93;I did not know that the bird belongs to you. I will make amends for my wrong and ransom myself with a large sum of money. Just spare my life.&#x94;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text t2">
            <p>The lion said, &#x93;Nothing can save you unless you will promise to give me that which first meets you upon your arrival at home. If you will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter as well.&#x94;</p>
            <p>The man hesitated, saying, &#x93;That could be my <a href="east2.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">youngest daughter.
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    &#x93;Will you give me your youngest daughter?&#x94;
                </span>
            </span></a> She loves me the most, and always runs to meet me when I return home.&#x94;</p>
            <p>The servant, however, was frightened and said, &#x93;Why must it be your daughter that meets you? It could also be a cat or a dog.&#x94;</p>
            <p>Then the man let himself be persuaded, took the singing, springing lark, and promised to give the lion whatever should first meet him at home.</p>
