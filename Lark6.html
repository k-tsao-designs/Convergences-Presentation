            <p>She had a room built there, so strong and thick that no ray of light could penetrate it. He was to sit inside it when the wedding lights were lit. However, the door was made of green wood which split, leaving a little crack that no one noticed.</p>
            <p>The wedding was celebrated with splendor, but when the procession returning from the church with all its torches and lights passed by this room, a ray of <a href="east6.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">light

Thus she went further and further into the wide world. She neither looked aside nor rested. When the seven years were almost past, she rejoiced, thinking that they would soon be redeemed, but they were far from it.</p>
            <p>One day when she was thus walking onward, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared.</p>
