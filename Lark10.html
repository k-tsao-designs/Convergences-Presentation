            <p>She said, &#x93;God will still help me,&#x94; and opened the little chest that the sun had given her. Inside was a dress that glistened like the sun itself. She took it out and put it on, then went up into the castle, where everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment.</p>
            <p>The bride liked the dress so well that she thought it could be her wedding dress, and she asked if it was for <a href="east12.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">sale
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    It's not for sale for gold or money.

            <p>That night after the youth was already asleep she was led into his room. She sat down on the bed and said,</p>
            <!--insert text-block-11 here-->
            <p>However, the prince was so sound asleep that it only seemed to him like the wind was rustling outside in the fir trees.</p>
            <p>When morning broke she was led out again, and she had to give up the golden dress.</p>
