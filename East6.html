            <p>So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the same as before. A man came and lay down beside her; but in the middle of the night, when she heard that he was fast asleep, she got up and lit the candle. She let the <a href="lark6.html"><span class="lark-link tooltip">light

She fell so deeply in love with him, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss at once. And so she did, but as she kissed him she let three drops of hot tallow drip onto his shirt, and he woke up.</p>

She lives in a castle east of the sun and west of the moon, and there, too, is a princess, one with a nose three yards long, and now I will have to marry her.&#x94;</p>
            <p>She cried and grieved, but there was no help for it; he had to go. Then she asked if she could go with him.</p>
