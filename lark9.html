            <p>And she went on a long, long way, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together. There she heard that a feast was to be held soon, at which they were to be married.</p>

        <div class="text t2">
            <p>She said, &#x93;God will still help me,&#x94; and opened the little chest that the sun had given her. Inside was a dress that glistened like the sun itself. She took it out and put it on, then went up into the castle, where everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment.</p>
            <p>The bride liked the dress so well that she thought it could be her wedding dress, and she asked if it was for <a href="east12.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">sale.

        <div class="text t3">
            <p>The bride did not want to allow this, but she wanted very much to have the dress, so at last she consented. However, she ordered a servant to give the prince a sleeping-potion.</p>
            <p>That night after the youth was already asleep she was led into his room. She sat down on the bed and said,</p>

            <p>However, the prince was so sound asleep that it only seemed to him like the wind was rustling outside in the fir trees.</p>
            <p>When morning broke she was led out again, and she had to give up the golden dress.</p>
