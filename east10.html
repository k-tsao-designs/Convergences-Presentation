            <p>She rode many weary days, before she got to the east wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and she asked the east <a href="lark7.html"><span class="lark-link tooltip">wind
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    She said to it, &#x93;You blow over all the trees and under all the leaves. Have you not seen a little white dove flying?&#x94;
                </span>
            </span></a> if he could tell her the way to the prince who lived east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the east wind had often heard tell of it, the prince and the castle, but he didn't know the way there, for he had never blown so far.</p>
            <p>&#x93;But, if you want, I'll go with you to my brother the west wind. Maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. If you will just get on my back I'll carry you there.&#x94;</p>
            <p>Yes, she got on his back, and off they went in a rush.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text t2">
            <p>When they arrived at the west wind's house, the east wind said the girl he had brought was the one who was supposed to have had the prince who lived in the castle east of the sun and west of the moon. She had set out to find him, and he had brought her here, and would be glad to know if the west wind knew how to get to the castle.</p>
            <p>&#x93;No,&#x94; said the west wind, &#x93;I've never blown so far; but if you want, I'll go with you to our brother the south wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flown far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. Get on my back, and I'll carry you to him.&#x94;</p>
            <p>Yes, she got on his back, and so they traveled to the south wind, and I think it didn't take long at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text t3">
            <p>When they got there, the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon, for she was the one who was supposed to have had the prince who lived there.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Is that so?&#x94; said the south wind. &#x93;Is she the one? Well, I have visited a lot of places in my time, but I have not yet blown there. If you want, I'll take you to my brother the north wind; he is the oldest and strongest of us all, and if he doesn't know where it is, you'll never find anyone in the world to tell you. Get on my back, and I'll carry you there.&#x94;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text t4">
            <p>Yes, she got on his back, and away he left his house at a good clip. They were not long underway. When they reached the north wind's house he was so wild and cross, that he blew cold gusts at them from a long way off. &#x93;Blast you both, what do you want?&#x94; he roared at them from afar, so that it struck them with an icy shiver.</p>
        </div>
        <!--insert text-block-5 here-->
        <div class="text t5">
            <p>&#x93;Yes, I know where it is,&#x94; said the north wind; &#x93;a single time I blew an aspen leaf there, but afterward I was so tired that I couldn't blow a puff for many days. But if you really wish to go there, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you there.&#x94;</p>
            <p>Yes, with all her heart; she wanted to and had to get there if it were at all possible; and she wouldn't be afraid, however madly he went.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Very well, then,&#x94; said the north wind, &#x93;but you must sleep here tonight, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get there at all.&#x94;</p>
